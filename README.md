## Overview

The "MobInsight API Project" is designed to provide users with the ability to search for phone details using an external API. The project is for learning how to work with APIs and handling dynamic content.

## Technologies Used

- HTML5
- Tailwind CSS
- JavaScript (ES6)
- [External API](https://github.com/ProgrammingHero1/phone-hunter-api)

## Features

- Search field to display phones based on the search criteria.
- The phone details will be shown once you press on search.
- Further details will be shown once the "Details" button is pressed.
- 'Show All' button to display the rest of the phones.

_Note: The algorithm used to display and redisplay the product cards is not efficient and optimal. It was implemented this way to grasp some concepts of JavaScript._
